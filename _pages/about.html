				<p>What's this all about?</p>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>I Brew My Own Coffee was born out of passion. We wanted to help teach others how to brew great coffee at home or in the office. When we launched the site in September 2014, we threw a lot of things at the wall and the podcast seemed to stick. The I Brew My Own Coffee Podcast has been a great medium to help share our passion for coffee with everyone.</p>

				<p>How do you find people to interview?</p>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>There is no real method here. We really enjoy talking with individuals outside of the coffee industry who work a 9 to 5 and have a passion for coffee in some way. Much like <a href="/blog/episode-4-errin-vasquez-larivercampcoffee/">Errin Vasquez</a> who started a meetup in LA before work where 30 or so people gather to brew coffee outside together.</p>

				<p>What is your favorite method to brew coffee?</p>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>It is a tough race between the Chemex and Kalita Wave. Most often we brew new coffees with a Chemex to experience the natural and delicate flavors the coffee offers. Depending on the roast and flavors we usually end up brewing with the Kalita Wave. We have found it to produce a very clean and full bodied cup of coffee that we really enjoy.</p>
