excerpt: Slow brewed coffee has become a hobby, a form of meditation for some, and my favorite way to start the day. We are not coffee "snobs". We don't turn down a fresh cup of Keurig coffee at family gatherings mmmmm.

There are plenty of ways to brew a great cup of coffee at home. We tested most of the popular brewing methods being used today and collected our favorites with pros and cons for each.

**The main criteria used for the review:**

* Produces a consistent quality tasting coffee.
* The easier to clean the better.
* Can I take it with me on vacation, camping, etc?
* Affordable, under $40.
* Good for making cold brew?

**Brewing devices not included:**

* Drip coffee makers. We have all had them and know what you get. No need to go over the quality of them.
* Keurig coffee machines.
* Any type of espresso machine.

**1. Kalita Wave $34.90**

The Kalita Wave comes in first for many reasons. We have found it to be a perfect balance between the thickness of an Aeropress and the thin taste a Chemex and V60 produces. A perfect travel companion. Made from metal, you don't have to worry about breaking this guy when you're out camping.

**Pros**: portable, easy to clean, flat bottom ensures an even draw down, great for cold brew.

**Cons**: needs attention from start to finish, takes longer than other pour overs.

***

**2. Chemex 6-Cup $36.95**

The Chemex is a classic. From it's well known glass figure to it's clean cup of coffee, it's timeless and easily liked. Come summer time, just throw some ice cubes in the device and brew like you normally would a hot Chemex. Versatile.

**Pros**: easy to clean, makes more than one cup.

**Cons**: made from glass, sometimes produces "thin" tasting coffee.

***

**3. The Aeropress $25.95**

Most notable within the geek community, the Aeropress is a great entry level brewing device. Pour grounds in, add water and plunge. More details will be available in the book covering all the various methods of brewing with this fella.

**Pros**: indestructible, rich body and taste.

**Cons**: produces small amount of coffee, inconsistent results, hard to plunge.

***

**4. V60 $23.00**

Popping up in cafes everywhere, the V60 is an easy brew method. With it's single hole in the bottom of the dripper, all you need is a steady pour of water and you're all set.

**Pros**: user friendly, produces a consistent and bright cup.

**Cons**: sometimes produces "thin" tasting coffee.

***

**5. French Press $26.25**

Easy to use and even easier to mess up. The French Press is often the first foray beyond drip coffee makers. Dump the grounds in, pour in boiling hot water and forget it. The book will offer more insights on how to use a French Press properly but for the sake of humanity, once the french press is done. Pour the coffee into another vessel so it doesn't sit there steeping in the grounds.

**Pros**: makes more than one cup, set it and forget it, more full body flavors come through.

**Cons**: lots of parts to clean, sludgy tasting coffee, easy to over extract.

***

**6. Moka Pot $24.21**

A nice hunk of metal that uses the same concept as the siphon, but in a less intimidating way. Heat is applied to the base (whether a stovetop or campfire) and the water is transferred upward passing through the grounds. SCIENCE!

**Pros**: unique flavors, great for camping, fun to use.

**Cons**: not fun to clean, takes a long time, produces small amount of coffee.

***

**7. Siphon $59.00**

The most intimidating and sexy device of the bunch. Only use when trying to impress the lady. Not much to say beyond that.

**Pros**: fun to use, unique tasting coffee.

**Cons**: unrealistic to wake up and make a siphon, expensive, requires a heat source, easy to "burn" coffee while brewing.
