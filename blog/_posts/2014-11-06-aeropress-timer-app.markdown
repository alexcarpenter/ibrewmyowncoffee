excerpt: The Aeropress is often the gateway drug into the slow brewed coffee scene. With its ease of use and simple clean up, itâ€™s a step away from the french press that demands just a little more attention. The Aeropress is a favorite of many experienced coffee lovers as well. There is even a whole competition series just for the Aeropress.

The Aeropress Timer is a great companion app for the Aeropress. The app comes loaded with a currated selection of recipes both for the popular inverted method as well as the classic method.
