### Products:

**Snow Peak Collapsable Pour Over ($29.95)**<br>
The Snow Peak Collapsible Pour Over is for that rugged outdoorsman who prefers to brew their coffee in the wild. The design of this product allows for easy travel and easy set up. The whole pour over collapses down into a lightweight flat brewer that can be packed away on any trip. Because it's made of stainless steel, the brewer will not shatter or break if it's tossed around in a bag. It's the perfect gift for the adventure seekers who enjoy good coffee.

**Hario Ceramic Coffee Mill ($29)**<br>
Whether you just don't feel ready to commit to an electric grinder or you love the simplicity of hand grinders, this Hario Ceramic Coffee Mill is great for everyone. It's design allows for easy use and consistency. Those ceramic burrs not only guarantee that it will last a long time, but also grinds coffee in a fantastic uniform way and can be adjustable to any grind size just by holding the burrs in place and tightening the adjustment ring in the upper chamber of the grinder.

Still not convinced? Let's talk about it's size. This grinder is not only kitchen counter friendly, but it's also easy for traveling and can be packed into any suitcase or backpack. Also, it doesn't take any electricity to use… Camper friendly.

**Soma Water ($49)**<br>
We've talked about the importance of good quality water when brewing coffee in the past and this product should be at the top of any water-conscious coffee enthusiasts' Christmas List. Not only is the design beautiful and shatterproof, but everything that this stands for is on point. The filter that is provided, which is made of 100% biodegradable products, filters your water to a high quality and Water Quality Association certified product. This filter has passed many testings and has received a gold seal standard which is a

key benchmark for any good reputable filter. What happens with the filter once it's done? Well, Soma estimates that it takes about 2 months to filter through 40 gallons of water (the life expectancy of a single filter) so they set customers up with a delivery system that will send you as many filters as you purchase. And to wrap it all up, every purchase made has a percentage donated to Charity:water, a great organization seeking to bring clean water all over the world to those who need it the most.

**Hario Cold Brew Pot ($19.71)**<br>
One of the best things about coffee is that it's not only a delicious hot beverage but a fantastic cold brew. A huge growing trend this year has been at home cold brews. This Hario Cold Brew Pot has everything you need all in one pot. No need to brew a french press and store it in a Ball Mason Jar. Simply place the coffee grounds in the filter basket, pout water and let steep. Once it's done, remove the grounds from the beverage, place the lid back on the pot and place in the refrigerator to enjoy later.

**Studio Neat Ice Kit ($60)**<br>
While we're on the topic of cold brew and it's fresh in the memory, you're going to want some nice ice cubes to have floating around in your freshly brewed iced coffee. The Studio Neat Ice Kit produces high quality ice cubes that will not dilute your cold brew coffee when you drink it.

**Ugmonk Slow and Steady T-Shirt ($26)**<br>
Let's be honest, we just love seeing a well designed T-Shirt that is made by a killer company. Ugmonk has some great shirts on their site, but this one just screams out to the coffee brewers. Just a great reminder that brewing coffee at home is a way to slow down to take time out of the day to enjoy your coffee.
