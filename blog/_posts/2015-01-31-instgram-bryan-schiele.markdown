excerpt: This past week coffee nerd/photographer Bryan Schiele took over our Instagram and inspired us to start doing more. His photos are beautifully produced and has some great questions to ask throughout the week. Here is a look back on what Bryan posted.

For those of you who don't know me, I like long walks through the woods, colorful backdrops, and Nyeri region Kenyas. This afternoon I'm enjoying the Chorongi, a Nyeri region Kenya from [@heartroasters](http://instagram.com/heartroasters)! I brewed it both as espresso and as a pourover (what I often refer to as my "one and one") to experience the differences in extraction side-by-side. It's always fascinating for me to see how a coffee performs using a variety of brew methods!

Like many of you, I drink a lot of coffee. In order to keep track of it all, I've created a spreadsheet on my iPad. One table is an entry of all my coffee bags with info about their roast date, amount, regional info, and flavor notes. Another table has info about every brew with the amount, grind settings, brew method, brew ratio, brew notes, and an area to jot down my thoughts. Both tables work together and are able to tell me exactly how much coffee I have left, how fresh it is, and even if it's time for me to share coffee with others!

Am I crazy? Do you track your coffee brewing somehow?

### Wednesday:

I recently added the [Kalita Wave 155](http://amzn.to/1HxH0RQ) (aka Baby Wave) to my arsenal of brew methods. After using it for the past few weeks, it got me thinking again about the importance of both 'form' and 'function' in the tools we use to brew coffee. I believe our tools should not only work properly to produce the best possible cup, but they should also be a joy to use and even a pleasure to view or to hold. Every time I stare down at the Kalita filter while brewing, it's a lovely sight â€“ but best of all, it produces a solid cup of coffee. I feel the same way about my Chemex, my [@monarchmethods](http://instagram.com/monarchmethods) [320ml copper kettle](http://monarchmethods.com/collections/all/products/mk320), and even my [@acmeandco](http://instagram.com/acmeandco) cups.

What tools do you use to brew that are both functional and beautiful?

### Thursday:

If you're like me, you probably buy most of your coffee from your local roaster or from roasters online. A little over a year ago, I made the investment on a small $350 [Behmor 1600](http://amzn.to/1wMP31E) and some green coffee at [@sweetmarias](http://instagram.com/sweetmarias) and began fiddling with home-roasting. After doing a lot of research online and tinkering quite a bit with the machine, I was able to consistently produce pretty great coffee! The best part was, though my beans may never win a competition, I enjoyed the whole experience of brewing MY OWN coffee so much more, and I quickly developed a new respect for the producers and the professionals who roast great coffee for a living.

Ever thought about buying your own green coffee and roasting it yourself? Do you have any good tips to help someone get started?

### Friday:

I love how low the barrier to entry is for folks to make great coffee in their homes! Though many of us coffee nerds enjoy tinkering with more costly and elaborate gadgets, the average coffee drinker can start brewing amazing coffee with just a few inexpensive purchases and a handful of YouTube videos. Far and away, besides the coffee, the most important purchase you'll make is a good quality burr grinder. Grind size consistency, reliability, maintainability, and the flexibility to repeatedly modify grind size is critical to nailing that perfect brew. Whatever your budget, I always recommend investing at least 65% of it toward the purchase of a solid grinder.

I've got a [Hario Slim Mill](http://amzn.to/1Lv4bLU) hand grinder for the office and travel, a Baratza Preciso for filter, and this [Macap M4D](http://amzn.to/1Lv4iHq) dedicated for espresso. What do you grind with at home?
