### Who are you and what do you do?

I am Joe Marrocco. I work at Cafe' Imports as a Sales Associate and the Director of Education. I also volunteer for the SCAA as a lead instructor and serve on the Roasters Guild Executive Council. When not absorbed in coffee stuff, I hang with my wife and kids, cooking, finding stuff to do outside, and looking for excuses to spend more time with good people.

### What is your favorite brewing technique and why?

My favorite brewing technique is the Chemex. I am a believer in pour over methods, whether conventional brewers, or little v-60s. They generally extract coffee cleanly, efficiently, repeatably and relatively easily. The Chemex allows me to control my extraction variables, keep things personal as I am personally doing the work, all while allowing me to have plenty of coffee to share.

### What's your recipe?

My recipe is simple. Simple is best. Simple is the most repeatable and typically allows for the best extraction. In my opinion, coffee wants to be extracted and water wants to extract it. Get the two together in a natural way and your solution shouldn't be super hard to regulate if you have you initial ratios, temps, and grind set.

<ul>
<li>I like a 16g of water to 1g of coffee ratio.  Pre-wet filter (a better term may be "wash" filter with hot water.)</li><li>Add coffee to filter.</li><li>Put Chemex on a scale and tare the scale with the coffee loaded.</li><li>Completely fill your pouring kettle. Why?? Because as you get deeper in your pour your water level lowers. The lower it gets the less heat it can retain. Use more than what you will use in the brew.</li><li>Begin pouring very close to the the coffee. Add about 10% of the amount you want to end up with. For example, if you are going for 1000g extraction, apply 100g of water here. Allow this to be absorbed by the grounds. This is called the bloom. It pushed the last of the stored carbon-dioxide out of the coffee, priming it to then release it's solvable material into the next 900g of water it will meet.</li><li>The bloom should take about 30 seconds, if your coffee is fresh. If not, no time at all.</li><li>Now, in the center, pour very slowly and closely to the grounds again. I am not a believer in pouring around much. I believe in diffusion via natural osmosis. Just allow the water and the coffee to co-mingle. I like to lift the majority of the coffee by pouring in the center when pouring into a cone shaped brewer.</li><li>Maintain the height of your "slurry" or bed of grounds, while trying not to let it fall. If you are familiar with cupping, try to keep the surface tension on most of your slurry intact. This allows for a more repeatable extraction. Also, if you allow it to fall you will clog the draw down.</li><li>Continue to pour, stopping as little as possible.</li><li>I call my method "passive extraction". Just let nature run it's course.</li><li>Your brew should end between 3:30 and 4:30, depending on your quantity.</li></ul>
