### Who are you and what do you do?

I'm currently the Milwaukee division of Kickapoo Coffee Roasters. Currently I'm doing wholesale work with the company however I've always been a person known to get involved in as much as possible. Perhaps that's more suitable for another interview.

### What is your favorite brewing technique and why?

Pour-over. To me it's the perfect amount of simplicity for the quality that is in resulting cup. Yes, there are auto-drip units out there that can and will do as good of a job but I really like the tiny amount of work that is necessary from the user (pouring). Aeropress is a very close second because of it's versatility and in third place I'm going to mention espresso, specifically because a well made espresso may very well may represent my favorite brewing technique BUT it's not the type of everyday thing I will be making in my pajamas.

### What's your typical recipe?

42 grams of coffee with 672 grams of water (1:16).

### What's one helpful tip for someone just getting into brewing their own coffee that you would suggest?

Don't skimp on the grinder!
