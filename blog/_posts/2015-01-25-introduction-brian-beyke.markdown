excerpt: We are beyond excited to have Brian on board reviewing a coffee each month for our site. He caught our eye right away for his quality of reviews on his personal site Abandoned Coffee.

His style of writing is informative and full. Not only does he give the specs about the farm and the beans, but also some flavor notes for a select number of brewing devices that he has brewed up.

Brian is no stranger to good coffee and if youâ€™re looking for some beautiful mouth-watering shots, take a look at his [Instagram account](http://instagram.com/losantivillecoffee). 

Check out his first review of Supersonics Ndumberi over <a href="/coffeereviews/supersonic-ndumberi/">here</a>.
