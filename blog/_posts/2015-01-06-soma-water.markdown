excerpt: We mentioned this product in our Holiday Gift Guide for 2014 and after recently purchasing one, we would like to give it a quick review for those who are also thinking of investing in one (we highly recommend it!).

First of all, we should mention that we haven't had any sort of water filtration system in place besides what our city provides for our tap water. Therefore we cannot compare it with other products, we can just give you our personal review with the product.

With that being said, let's get into the review!

Before even purchasing our carafe, we fell in love with the story behind Soma. Sustainability is a huge part of Soma and is found in the actual products themselves. The filter casing is made from compostable and plant-based products. The glass-carafe is shatter-resistant. The cone is made of BPA-free plastic. The packaging contains recycled contents and materials. And the idea of using a filtered water system eliminates the need for any bottled water.

We can go even further to say that the actual company behind Soma believes in sustainability so much that the employees commit to public transportation to eliminate any waste, their manufacturing site has a recycling and composting make-up of 67% and operates on a natural gas co-generation system. In fact, in 2012 they were awarded the Green Supply Chain Award.

And to top it all off, for every filter that is bought from Soma, a donation is made to charity:water.

Soma is a company that cares. If you care, then you'll love this product.

Once you get the carafe, simply soak the filter for a while and place in the top chamber of the carafe. Fill up and discard at least 3â€“4 times before enjoying the first glass of purely filtered water. We loved that in the directions it encouraged watering your plants with the discarded water. Then you simply fill your carafe and enjoy! It's as simple as that. The first time we had a glass, we immediately noticed just how crisp it felt. Pouring water from the carafe is smooth and easy. There's no awkward buttons you have to push or anything to release the water, just simple pour like you would a freshly brewed Chemex (which, being the coffee nerds we are, the design is beautiful!).

In a few months (Soma suggests that each filter lasts up to 2 months or 40 gallons of water) order your replacement filter or subscribe to automatically receive them every 60 days.

It's a product you can feel good about owning.
