excerpt: Some would argue coffee is best served outside. We tend to agree so we put together a list of what our camp coffee setup looks like at the moment.

Here is our current setup. It tends to change quite often so this will be updated accordingly.

### [Topo Designs Daypack &rarr;](http://topodesigns.com/collections/bags/products/daypack)

Topo Designs is a great American made brand that we respect and recommend to anyone looking for a good quality bag. Not only is the design on point, but the durability is perfect for any outdoor adventure to carry around your coffee gear. 

### [Aeropress &rarr;](http://amzn.to/16gZXaK)

The easiest brew method to use outdoors is the aeropress. It's durable and doesn't need any precise water pouring techniques. The easy cleanup is also a huge bonus since when you're outdoors, good clean water isn't always available.

### [Hario Skerton Hand Grinder &rarr;](http://amzn.to/161ng7Z)

Since we believe that coffee tastes the best when it's ground just moments before brewing, having a hand grinder with you is essential. We bring our Hario Skerton Hand Grinder everywhere that we travel to, and it's held up very nicely. Easy to use and can grind either a small amount or a large amount of coffee depending on the type of brew you're doing. Another great grinder that is small for packing purposes is the [Porlex Mini Hand Grinder](http://amzn.to/161sArT).

### [Able Brewing Disc Filter &rarr;](http://amzn.to/18FA59p)

The Able Brewing Disk Filter is easy to pack, easy to clean and easy to use. The main adjustment we make with our metal filter is that we tend to coarsen the grind just a hair. We highly recommend these disks to anyone looking for a reusable option for their aeropress. 

### [Jetboil Zip Stove &rarr;](http://amzn.to/1LAjO4Q)

Since outdoor outlets aren't common in the woods or in parks, you'll need to have something to heat up your water. In the past, we've used a simple camp Jet Boiler. It's easy to use and packs up pretty easily. If you're looking for something even lighter in weight, the Kinetic Ultra Titanium Stove by Olicamp is for you. Another honorable mention is the [Coleman F1 Exponent Stove](http://amzn.to/1EY5azM).
