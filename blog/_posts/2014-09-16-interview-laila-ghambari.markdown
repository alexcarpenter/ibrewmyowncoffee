### Who are you and what do you do?

Hi! My name is Laila Ghambari. I live in Seattle, Wa and work for Cherry Street Coffee House. My role at Cherry St is the Director of Coffee, meaning anything to do with coffee for our 10 locations is my job. My father and mother started the company over 20 years ago. Its really rewarding to work for my families business. Outside of work I'm also heavily involved in the coffee industry. I am on the Barista Guild Executive Council acting as the Chair of the Events Committee, I am a Specialty Coffee Association of America certified instructor, and just this year I won the United States Barista competition.

### What is your favorite brewing technique and why?

My wonderful partner Ryan Willbur also works in the coffee industry and typically makes the coffee for us in the morning. Since I make and teach coffee everyday for a living, its really nice to have someone else make my coffee for me each morning! We have been using Baratza grinders at home for a long time, constantly ungraded to the latest version whenever possible. We recently were able to get a Forte and have been happy with that home grinder. When I won the USBC I won a Mahlkonig EK43 and, although its a commercial grinder and is way to big for our city living kitchen, we couldn't resist being able to make our morning cup on such a coveted piece of equipment.

I've always been a fan of the Chemex but Ryan likes to use the Kalita Wave. We have a Bonavita home brewer and that is my favorite. No fuss, easy to use, and brews really great coffee. Ryan likes the ritual and I love the convenience.

### Whatâ€™s your recipe?

We generally stick to the pretty standard "60grams of coffee to 1000grams of water" recipe. We tend to use around 700 grams of water and about 40 grams of coffee when brewing coffee for just the 2 of us in the morning. That usually gives us each a little more than 1 cup of coffee in our respective mugs (he always drinks out of a unbranded not neutral mug and I have a cute little 8oz Intelligentsia mug I got in NY that I love). Brew time we shoot for is about 5 to 5 and a half minutes. Although Seattle has pretty good tap water, Ryan can be a bit of a water snob, so we buy fresh spring water from the grocery store.
