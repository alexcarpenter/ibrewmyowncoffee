excerpt: In the tenth episode of the I Brew My Own Coffee Podcast we chat with Bryan Schiele. Probably most notable for his colorful coffee photography on Instagram, we chat about how he got started working as a barista at Starbucks then moving into a software development job and how brewing coffee at home has become a hobby for him.
