excerpt: In the eighth episode of the I Brew My Own Coffee podcast, we chat about A Film About Coffee. This is by far our favorite coffee documentary and is one that we highly recommend to anyone who has an interest in coffee. The shots are beautiful, the information is incredibly accurate and your view on that morning cup of coffee will be different after watching.
