				<h2><a href="/blog/filters">Brewing Filters</a></h2>
				<!-- <p>Once you have your preferred brewing method picked out, it’s now time to stock up on filters. With full immersion brew methods, there is typically a metal filter that is a part of the device. This usually doesn’t give you any alternatives, which is perfectly fine!</p> -->

There is even a whole competition series just for the Aeropress.</p> -->
