		<p>Through the help of a generous friend we were able to acquire the Moka Pot for a quick weekend brew. The instructions given are beautifully illustrated, although short on any wording which made us a little weary about how to use it at first. We decided to go with our standard Moka Pot recipe to start. We filled the bottom chamber with water up to the bottom of the steam valve (roughly 300g of water), filled the basket with coffee (about 18 grams) and put it all together to brew directly on our stovetop.</p>

<p>Our first attempt may have been a little unsuccessful since we were used to the typical Moka Pot that is on the market today. Our water never completely made it into the brew and we were left with about 2oz of water in the pot. The slow dripping out the top caught us by surprise, we honestly had no clue where the coffee was going to come out, and its slow speed made us think we did something wrong. Nonetheless the brew that we had was very strong, espresso tasting and full bodied and we liked it a lot!</p>
