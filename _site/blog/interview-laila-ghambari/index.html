<h3>What is your favorite brewing technique and why?</h3>

<p>My wonderful partner Ryan Willbur also works in the coffee industry and typically makes the coffee for us in the morning. Since I make and teach coffee everyday for a living, its really nice to have someone else make my coffee for me each morning! We have been using Baratza grinders at home for a long time, constantly ungraded to the latest version whenever possible. We recently were able to get a Forte and have been happy with that home grinder. When I won the USBC I won a Mahlkonig EK43 and, although its a commercial grinder and is way to big for our city living kitchen, we couldn&#39;t resist being able to make our morning cup on such a coveted piece of equipment.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been a fan of the Chemex but Ryan likes to use the Kalita Wave. We have a Bonavita home brewer and that is my favorite. No fuss, easy to use, and brews really great coffee. Ryan likes the ritual and I love the convenience.</p>

<h3>Whatâ€™s your recipe?</h3>

<p>We generally stick to the pretty standard &quot;60grams of coffee to 1000grams of water&quot; recipe. We tend to use around 700 grams of water and about 40 grams of coffee when brewing coffee for just the 2 of us in the morning. That usually gives us each a little more than 1 cup of coffee in our respective mugs (he always drinks out of a unbranded not neutral mug and I have a cute little 8oz Intelligentsia mug I got in NY that I love). Brew time we shoot for is about 5 to 5 and a half minutes. Although Seattle has pretty good tap water, Ryan can be a bit of a water snob, so we buy fresh spring water from the grocery store.</p>
