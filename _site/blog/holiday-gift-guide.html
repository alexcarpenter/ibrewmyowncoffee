		<h3>Products:</h3>

<p><strong>Snow Peak Collapsable Pour Over ($29.95)</strong><br>
The Snow Peak Collapsible Pour Over is for that rugged outdoorsman who prefers to brew their coffee in the wild. The design of this product allows for easy travel and easy set up. The whole pour over collapses down into a lightweight flat brewer that can be packed away on any trip. Because it&#39;s made of stainless steel, the brewer will not shatter or break if it&#39;s tossed around in a bag. It&#39;s the perfect gift for the adventure seekers who enjoy good coffee.</p>

<p><strong>Hario Ceramic Coffee Mill ($29)</strong><br>
Whether you just don&#39;t feel ready to commit to an electric grinder or you love the simplicity of hand grinders, this Hario Ceramic Coffee Mill is great for everyone. It&#39;s design allows for easy use and consistency. Those ceramic burrs not only guarantee that it will last a long time, but also grinds coffee in a fantastic uniform way and can be adjustable to any grind size just by holding the burrs in place and tightening the adjustment ring in the upper chamber of the grinder.</p>

<p>Still not convinced? Let&#39;s talk about it&#39;s size. This grinder is not only kitchen counter friendly, but it&#39;s also easy for traveling and can be packed into any suitcase or backpack. Also, it doesn&#39;t take any electricity to use… Camper friendly.</p>

<p><strong>Soma Water ($49)</strong><br>
We&#39;ve talked about the importance of good quality water when brewing coffee in the past and this product should be at the top of any water-conscious coffee enthusiasts&#39; Christmas List. Not only is the design beautiful and shatterproof, but everything that this stands for is on point. The filter that is provided, which is made of 100% biodegradable products, filters your water to a high quality and Water Quality Association certified product. This filter has passed many testings and has received a gold seal standard which is a</p>

<p>key benchmark for any good reputable filter. What happens with the filter once it&#39;s done? Well, Soma estimates that it takes about 2 months to filter through 40 gallons of water (the life expectancy of a single filter) so they set customers up with a delivery system that will send you as many filters as you purchase. And to wrap it all up, every purchase made has a percentage donated to Charity:water, a great organization seeking to bring clean water all over the world to those who need it the most.</p>

<p><strong>Hario Cold Brew Pot ($19.71)</strong><br>
One of the best things about coffee is that it&#39;s not only a delicious hot beverage but a fantastic cold brew. A huge growing trend this year has been at home cold brews. This Hario Cold Brew Pot has everything you need all in one pot. No need to brew a french press and store it in a Ball Mason Jar. Simply place the coffee grounds in the filter basket, pout water and let steep. Once it&#39;s done, remove the grounds from the beverage, place the lid back on the pot and place in the refrigerator to enjoy later.</p>

<p><strong>Studio Neat Ice Kit ($60)</strong><br>
While we&#39;re on the topic of cold brew and it&#39;s fresh in the memory, you&#39;re going to want some nice ice cubes to have floating around in your freshly brewed iced coffee. The Studio Neat Ice Kit produces high quality ice cubes that will not dilute your cold brew coffee when you drink it.</p>

<p><strong>Ugmonk Slow and Steady T-Shirt ($26)</strong><br>
Let&#39;s be honest, we just love seeing a well designed T-Shirt that is made by a killer company. Ugmonk has some great shirts on their site, but this one just screams out to the coffee brewers. Just a great reminder that brewing coffee at home is a way to slow down to take time out of the day to enjoy your coffee.</p>

<h3>Coffee Subscriptions:</h3>

<p>Ever wish there was a way to have delicious coffee delivered to your door so that you have an endless supply? Well…there is! Coffee Subscriptions are a perfect way to keep your coffee stash stocked on a timely basis and there are many great companies that are doing just that! Take a look at a few that we have chosen to highlight:</p>

<p><strong>Blue Bottle at Home Subscription</strong><br>
Blue Bottle is known for their coffee subscription program. Start off buying receiving their free sample to get a taste of what this company is all about and then you can move into your coffee subscription. Whether it&#39;s a half bag of 6oz or a triple bag of 32oz, Blue Bottle has the perfect size for the coffee sipper or coffee chuggers out there.</p>

<p><strong>Pony Brand Coffee</strong><br>
A well crafted simple subscription company that supplies coffee based on the flavor characteristics that resonate better with what you like in your coffee. Don&#39;t know which one to choose from? Grab their 4x4 Sampler and choose one from there!</p>

<p><strong>Craft Coffee</strong><br>
Craft Coffee gives you a short survey to fill out in order to match the perfect coffee to what you&#39;re looking for. They set you up with a delivery plan and allow you to either continue with the same coffees that you enjoy or help you to venture out into new ones.

<p><strong>Toms Roasting Club</strong><br>
Toms is a familiar brand that has been blowing up ever since they launched their One for One shoe campaign. It wasn&#39;t long until they reached into the coffee community and started a coffee subscription where with each bag of coffee bought, Toms would provide a week of clean water for one person.</p>

<h3>Charities To Support:</h3>

<p><strong>Charity:Water</strong><br>
A well known organization that strives to bringing clean water to countries all over the world. Whether you&#39;re donating your money, buying some of their great looking products that show your support, or even setting up your own charity:water fundraising campaign, this company is finding every way to get the word spread and getting clean water to everyone. Some of their projects, once the money is raised, include drilling wells, setting up piped systems to supply water to other communities, water purification systems, latrines and more!</p>

<p><strong>Coffee Kids</strong><br>
Coffee Kids works with coffee-farming communities all throughout Latin America to create projects in education, health case, econimics, food security and building. With these areas come skill building, people skills, women owned businesses, scholarships, workshops, and more to help build a sustainable community.</p>
