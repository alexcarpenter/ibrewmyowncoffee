		<h2 class="Article__excerpt">While co-pilots and pioneers have been following alongside Berkeley, CA’s Supersonic Coffee for a few months now, most of us have been waiting for the offerings to be more widely available.  It’s true I was able to try a few of their offerings earlier in 2014, but I was glad to finally see the launch of their webstore, and try some of their new offerings that came along with it. One of those we will look at today, their Ndumberi, Kenya.</h2>
		
		
		<p>This coffee from Ndumberi is graded AA. In Kenya, AA means that the beans are above the screen size 17/18. This grade is determined after the beans have dried and the different sized beans are separated using screens with various sizes of holes in them. “Screen size 17/18” mean that the beans were too large to pass through the 18mm and 17mm holes, while “screen 20” means they didn’t pass through the 20mm holes. </p>

<p>The screen size of coffee beans will vary based on their variety and the growing conditions of the coffee plants. Bigger screen sizes are regarded as the best quality coffee whereas smaller ones are regarded inferior.</p>

<p>This screening is just one step of the sorting process, where the goal is to end up with only the best coffee beans regarded as “grade 1 coffee”.</p>

<p>The Ndumberi Cooperative Society dates back to 1962 and has been very successful in producing high quality coffee and paying back their members. They also offer training programs and give their members credits for investments on their farms along with access to fertilizer.</p>

<h3>Brew Method: Able Holiday Kone</h3>

<p><strong>30g (c) to 435g (w) | 3:00 total time | 208 degrees (Immersion mode)</strong></p>

<p>Oh yea, how interesting.  This cup is layered with blackberry syrup, currants black and red, green apple, coconut, all sorts of sizzly syrupy flavors bright on the front, dense in the middle, and clean/bright/creamy finishing. </p>

<p>It begins to grow a plump honey sweetness in the finish, still creamy, tingly, and growing a bit sweeter as it opens with vanilla bean emerging in the long finish. </p>

<p>It begins revealing more strawberry and rhubarb sweetness, and I&#39;m almost reminded of Kapsokisio from Tim Wendelboe as it softly flutters with rose all around the green apple highs.  Pineapple syrup too, all sorts of lazy and comforting properties.  There are notable differences though, as the notes never get as candied as the TW, but that is beside the point. </p>

<p>It is incredibly difficult to detail, as there is so much flavor condensed into each sip.  It may take me the entire bag to fully explore this coffee, and even then I may not see all it has to offer. </p>

<p>You note things like date, raisin, even tomato in there as the cup reaches its coolest moments. The cup becomes a bit shorter in its lingering, with a slightly drying, slightly spiced finish.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Brew Method: Chemex</h3>

<p><strong>30g (c) to 480g (w) | 4:00 total time | 207 degrees | 1.37 TDS | 20.14% Ext.</strong></p>

<p>Immediately post brew this cup is dense, right away pretty spiced with darker fruit notes like blackberry and black currant, green apple cleaning up after them. It&#39;s aggressive on the palate, but the lingering is jammy, sitting more like grape jelly or prune juice on the tongue in the long finish.</p>

<p>The aroma is sweet and perfumed, still dancing around grape. </p>

<p>Spiced caramel apple cider shortly after allowing some cooling, still plump and fruit filled but all these flavors are really buoyant in the mouth.  Rhubarb, strawberry, blackberry, red and black currant, vanilla all come in after a grapefruit brightened intro to the sips.  It begins developing a more quick finish, slightly drying, but slightly effervescent.  It leaves a lingering in the mouth like a flavorful and deep red wine and mulling spices. </p>

<p>Final sips stay tingly with the currant, cinnamon spiced, and bright as it leaves a slightly liquory, winey mouthfeel drifting away.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Brew Method: Kalita Wave</h3>

<p><strong>34g (c) to 552g (w) | 4:30 total time | 207 degrees | 1.40 TDS | 20.93 % Ext.</strong></p>

<p>This cup is immensely jelly-like on the front.  Tingly and tart with green apple and currant- creamy with a dense and drying citrus finish with a bit of astringency. </p>

<p>About ten minutes off brew it opens up, significantly more creamy, plump, buttery with caramel and vanilla sweetened with cinnamon kicking in the end.  The fruit notes now more of an accent to the maple pecan butter body.</p>

<p>Similar rhubarb and fruit sweetness liken to previous method as cools.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Brew Method: Aeropress</h3>

<p><strong>(Inverted) | 17g (c) to 240g (w) | 2:00 then plunge by 2:30 total time | 198 degrees (Immersion mode)</strong>
Very intense, but mellow. </p>

<p>Green apple, rhubarb, cinnamon. </p>

<p>Chewy caramel and chocolate, green apple, heavy whipping cream as it cools.</p>

<hr>

<p>The end of 2014 and beginning of 2015 have definitely showcased some truly incredible Kenyan coffees, and this Ndumberi from Supersonic is no exception.  In fact, it is one of the best Kenyan coffees I’ve had. It was deeply complex, and intricately layered.  One of those coffees that feel like every make and every sip of every make is different than the one before it. An ever-changing experience, an ongoing development. It is wonderfully aromatic, plump and syrupy in body, and dazzling on the palate. </p>
